    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>

    <h3>Homemade Lasagna</h3>
    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
      traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
      mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.

    <h4>How to Make Homemade Lasagna</h4>
    <p>
      Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full,
      step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can
      expect:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and
        crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir
        in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5
        teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until
        they're al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the
        remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe
        (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is
        assembled.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for
        about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is
        golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>
